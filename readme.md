# Religious buildings in Amsterdam

A one week project using `SparQL` for OBA(Openbare Bibliotheek Amsterdam)

Prototyping and testing the new experimental API using RDF from OBA. As goal to show what is possible to do with their linked data.

*Only working on the latest Chrome browser, because the JS needs to be transpiled first for it to work on other browsers.*


- *SparQL*: Read *Sparkle*
- RDF: Resource Description Framework
- Bibliotheek: Library
