# OBA 1 week project

A one week project using `SparQL` for OBA(Openbare Bibliotheek Amsterdam)

Prototyping and testing the new experimental API using RDF from OBA.


Only working on the latest Chrome browser atm, because the JS needs to be transpiled first for it to work on other browsers.


*SparQL*: Read *Sparkle*
RDF: Resource Description Framework
Bibliotheek: Library
